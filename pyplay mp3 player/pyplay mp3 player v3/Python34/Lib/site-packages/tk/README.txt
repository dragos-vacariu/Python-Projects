tk is an extension package written in Python (compatible with versions 2.7 and 3.3).
It provides supplemental classes and widgets to use with Tkinter.
In addition, there are various graphical tools to help display and manipulate graphs.

Coming Soon:
	LaTeX in Text widgets.

To install, download the appropriate installer (or archive) of the latest version.
(The archives contain a setup.py file which will install the package and all subpackages.
Run "python setup.py install" in a command-line interface to install from an archive.)
Windows users have two options: an executable installer (that also creates an uninstaller),
or a self-extracting Windows Installer.
