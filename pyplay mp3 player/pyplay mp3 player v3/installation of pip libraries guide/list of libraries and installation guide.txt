List of libraries to install after installing Python:

Here is how to do it:
Open command prompt and enter the command:

For Windows 7:
cd "filepath to Python executable" -> EX: cd C:/Python34/python.exe

For Windows 10:
cd /d "filepath to Python executable" -> EX: cd /d C:/Python34/python.exe

IF the .zip file containing pyplay has preinstalled Python:
PATH_TO_EXTRACTED_DOWNLOAD/pyplay mp3 player v3 preinstalled\Python310\

In order to install the libraries from WHL Files you should extract LIBRARIES_TO_INSTALL_MANUALLY.7z and copy the directory to your Python.

The local libraries available under: 
Python34\LIBRARIES_TO_INSTALL_MANUALLY 

are exactly the ones I used for building, compiling and testing the Software. If you install the libraries from the web, the version might differ
and some errors because of the incompatibility might occur - so take that into account.
